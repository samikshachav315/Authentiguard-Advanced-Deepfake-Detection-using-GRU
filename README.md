# AuthentiGuard – Advanced Deepfake Detection using GRU
-----Overview------
AuthentiGuard advanced Deepfake Detection using GRU project focused on detecting deepfake videos using deep learning techniques. The system leverages Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to capture temporal dependencies across video frames and identify manipulated content.

-----Architecture-----
1. Video Input
2. Frame Extraction (OpenCV)
3. Feature Extraction
4. GRU-based Temporal Modeling
5. Binary Classification (Real / Fake)

-----Technologies-----
- Python
- TensorFlow
- GRU (Recurrent Neural Network)
- OpenCV
- Streamlit
- Git & GitHub

-----Streamlit Demo-----
A Streamlit web application is used to demonstrate live deepfake detection by allowing users to upload videos and view prediction results.

-----Dataset-----
Dataset sourced from Kaggle Deepfake Datasets
(Dataset not uploaded due to size constraints)
